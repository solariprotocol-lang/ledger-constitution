# Ledger Constitution
The Ledger Constitution defines a permanent, non-centralized governance and memory framework intended to preserve truth, structural integrity, and operational clarity across long time horizons. This repository exists solely to host, version, and publicly anchor that constitution. It is not a product repository, a software implementation, or a roadmap.

The constitution establishes a strict seven-layer ontology governing immutability, validation, consensus, governance, identity, access, and incentive. These layers are intentionally minimal, non-overlapping, and non-negotiable. Any system built in reference to this ledger must either conform to these boundaries or explicitly diverge from them. There is no implicit compatibility.

This project is intentionally documentation-first. The rendered constitution hosted via GitHub Pages is the authoritative public reference. The Markdown source contained in this repository is the sole source of truth. Changes to the text are treated as constitutional amendments and should be approached accordingly.

This repository does not solicit contributions, features, or optimizations by default. Engineers, architects, and system designers reviewing this work should read the constitution in full before proposing implementation ideas, extensions, or critiques. The document is designed to function as a filter: alignment precedes participation.
